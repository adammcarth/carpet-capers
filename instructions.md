# Carpet Capers

Carpet Capers is a chain of carpet retail stores in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. They specialise in imported carpets and pride themselves on their great customer service and low-cost but good quality merchandise. Recently, the management has upgraded their computer hardware at each of the stores and has commissioned a software development company to produce a tailored software solution to reduce the time it takes their store sales staff to create a quote and proceed with a sale.

As part of the new system a quotation system is required to estimate the amount of carpet required and calculate the costs of the job, based on a range of options and measurements.
Customers generally come to the store knowing the physical dimensions (length and width, in metres) of each of the rooms they wish to carpet. From these dimensions, the floor area (in m2) is calculated. Over the years, the carpet manufacturing industry has determined that the most economical way to make carpet is in rolls which are `3.66` m wide – this is called a broadloom metre. Therefore, the area of a broadloom metre is 1 m times `3.66 m` or `3.66 m2`.

Therefore a room which is 3m long by 5m wide has an area of `15m2` and uses `15/3.66 = 4.01 B^2` where `B` is one broadloom metre. As carpet must be purchased by the metre, this would then be rounded up to 5 broadloom metres.

At Carpet Capers, there are 3 different qualities of carpet – Standard (which is sold at $20/blm), Premium (at $30/blm) and Executive (at $50/blm).
Carpet Capers also do volume discounts. If a customer wishes to carpet 3 rooms, they get the lowest cost room at half price, and if they carpet 4 or more, they get the lowest cost room for free.

Additionally, sales staff have some discretion in reducing the total cost by up to 5%, if they believe it will help them ultimately make a sale.
After all calculations, including applicable discounts, have been made GST of 10% must be added before the total is generated.
